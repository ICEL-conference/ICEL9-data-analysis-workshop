# Installation instructions for MATLAB
If you already have MATLAB, please make sure that you also have the [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html) and [Statistics & Machine Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html) installed.

If you do not have MATLAB, please install it following these [instructions](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/install-products-with-internet-connection.html). MATLAB is not free software but most academic institutions provide licenses to their employees and students. MATLAB also provides a 30-day free trial that you can find [here](https://nl.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials.html).
You will also need to select the Signal Processing and Statistics & Machine Learning Toolboxes when installing MATLAB for the first time.
